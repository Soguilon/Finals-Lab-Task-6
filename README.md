- This task focuses on performing fundamental MongoDB operations such as creating a database, inserting documents, and executing find, update, search, and delete actions within a collection.

## Step-by-Step Process:

1. Create a Database

* Start by creating or switching to a specific database.
* The selected database becomes the active workspace for all upcoming operations.

2. Insert Documents

* Within the database, a collection is created.
* Multiple documents are inserted into the collection, each containing structured data fields such as name, age, or address.

3. FIND Documents

* Display all documents stored in the collection.
* Use filters to find specific documents based on certain values like name or ID.

4. UPDATE Documents

* Locate the document that needs modification using a condition (e.g., name or ID).
* Specify the field(s) to be changed and apply the update.
* Confirm the update by checking the document again.

5. SEARCH Documents

* Use specific criteria to locate documents that match particular conditions (e.g., age greater than a value or status equals a specific string).
* Review the matched results for accuracy.

6. DELETE Documents

* Identify the document(s) to be removed using a condition.
* Remove the document(s) from the collection.
* Verify deletion by checking the collection contents.
